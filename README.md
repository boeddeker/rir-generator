# RIR-Generator

The image method, proposed by Allen and Berkley in 1979 [1], is probably one of the most frequently used methods in the acoustic signal processing community to create synthetic room impulse responses. 
A mex-function, which can be used in MATLAB, was developed to generate multi-channel room impulse responses using the image method. 
This function enables the user to control the reflection order, room dimension, and microphone directivity. 

This repository includes a tutorial, MATLAB examples, and the source code of the mex-function.
A similar interface is available as a Python module and a C++ shared library.

# Credits

 - EmanuÃ«l Habets (https://github.com/ehabets/RIR-Generator): Provided C++ code with MATLAB bindings
 - Marvin (https://github.com/Marvin182/rir-generator): Add python bindings
 - Here:
   - Remove shared library and rewrite code, that it only uses cython
   - Let setup.py do everything (i.e. drop makefile call), i.e. support pip 
   - Convert examples to tests
